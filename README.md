# OpenStack Testing High-Level Design

*This repository provides a test environment for OpenStack deployments.
It is designed to simplify the process of experimenting with different services, configurations, and automation workflows without affecting production systems.*

## Objective & Scope

The objective is to establish a comprehensive testing framework for OpenStack that ensures reliability, performance, and security across its distributed cloud computing architecture.

**Testing Scope:**
- Core services (Nova, Neutron, Cinder, Swift, Keystone, Glance, Horizon)
- Integration between services
- API compatibility and stability
- Scalability under various load conditions
- Security posture across the platform
- Upgrade paths and backward compatibility
- Multi-tenancy isolation

## High-Level Environment / Architecture

The test environment would be organized in the following layers:

1. **Development Testing Environment**
   - Minimal OpenStack deployment with core services
   - Isolated from production

2. **Integration Testing Environment**
   - Complete OpenStack deployment on virtual infrastructure deployed on-prem or AWS
   - Multiple nodes simulating distributed architecture
   - Configured for multi-region testing
   - Snapshots available for quick restoration after destructive tests

3. **Performance/Scale Testing Environment**
   - Larger deployment (8+ nodes) with hardware similar to production
   - Configured to test maximum capacity boundaries
   - Isolated network to prevent interference with test results

Each environment would leverage infrastructure-as-code (Terraform/Heat) for consistent provisioning and configuration management tools (Ansible) for repeatable setup.

## Testing Strategy

**Priority Test Types**

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Fast feedback on individual components in Development environment
   - High coverage of code paths within services - make changes in Neutron and test only it

2. **API Tests**
   - Verify API
   - Ensure backward compatibility
   - Test error conditions and specific edge cases

3. **Integration Tests**
   - Verify interactions between services - if we have patches in one service, check that all other services works stable
   - Test configuration changes
   - Validate authentication flows

4. **Functional Tests**
   - End-to-end workflows (provision VM, attach storage, configure networking)
   - Multi-tenant scenarios
   - Resource lifecycle management

5. **Chaos/Resilience Tests**
   - Component failures and recovery
   - Network partitioning scenarios
   - Resource exhaustion handling

6. **Upgrade Tests**
   - In-place upgrades
   - Rolling upgrades with minimal downtime
   - Rollback procedures

**Reliability & Maintainability Approach**

- **Code Organization** Test code organized by service (Neutron, Nova, etc.) and feature area
- **Test Isolation** Each test must clean up resources, even on failure
- **Test Data Management** Fixtures and factories for consistent test data
- **Parameterization** Reuse test logic across different configurations
- **Tagging** Label tests by duration, environment requirements, and service area

**Tools & Languages**
- Python with pytest for unit and functional tests
- Tempest framework for integrated OpenStack testing
- Rally for performance and scale testing
- Selenium for Horizon UI testing
- Postman for API testing collections

## CI / Run Strategy & Observability

**Pipeline Integration**

1. **Pre-commit Stage**
   - Unit tests
   - Linting and static analysis
   - Security scanning (Bandit, Snyk, Sonar)

2. **Commit Stage**
   - Fast integration tests
   - API compatibility checks

3. **Daily Build Stage**
   - Jenkins Nightly builds
   - Full integration test suite
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Upgrade tests from previous release

4. **Weekly Stage**
   - Extended soak testing
   - Multi-region deployment tests
   - Chaos engineering scenarios

**Observability Strategy**

**Metrics Collection**
- Test execution time and success rates
- Resource utilization during tests (CPU, memory, network, disk)
- API response times and error rates
- Database query performance
- Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring the system

**Logging**
- Centralized logging with ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Log level adjustment during test failures for more detail
- Logs categorized by service and severity

**Failure Debugging**
- Automatic collection of state at failure (stack traces, system stats)
- Service topology mapping at time of failure
- Snapshot of test environment configuration for reproducibility

**Dashboards**
- Real-time test execution status
- Historical test reliability by component
